# Fullscreen SoT Map Chrome Extension (deprecated since 11/02/18)
**Note: this extension is deprecated since the website has changed the side-panel to be hideable**

A chrome extension to remove the side panel on the interactive [**sea-of-thieves map**](http://maps.seaofthieves.rarethief.com/) allowing the map to be displayed in fullscreen.

## Installation
1. Download the files from this repo
2. Go to your [**chrome extensions**](chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable developper mode
4. Load the unpacked extension
5. Navigate to the [**SoT map**](http://maps.seaofthieves.rarethief.com/) and enjoy!

Alternatively, you can simply copy and execute the code from [**removePanel.js**](removePanel.js) in the browser console while you're on the map.
